Main module for the Tic-Tac-Toe game.

This module contains the main game logic and entry points for both
single-player and multiplayer modes. It handles game initialization,
player input, and game flow control.

The game supports boards from 3x3 to 9x9 and includes various
difficulty levels for the AI opponent in single-player mode.
